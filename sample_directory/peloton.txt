The peloton travels as an integrated unit (similar in some respects to birds flying in formation) with each rider making slight adjustments in response to their adjacent riders (particularly the rider in front of them). Riders at the front are fully exposed to wind resistance, hence experience much higher fatigue loads. After a period of time at the front, they will manoeuvre farther back in the peloton to recover. With sufficient room to manoeuvre, the peloton appears in time lapse as a fluid cloud, with an endless stream of riders pushing from the back through to the leading edge, then falling away. In addition to bird flock formations, peloton behavior involving drafting or similar energy-saving mechanisms has been identified in a variety of biological systems.[4][5][6][7]

The shape or formation of the peloton changes according to many factors. A strong headwind or a hard effort tends to spread out or string out the riders into a long narrow formation, sometimes single file. A slow pace or brisk tailwind greatly relieves the fatigue penalty for riding in a formation that fills the road from one side to the other, and in these situations riders ride side by side. When two or more groups of riders have reason to contest control of the peloton, several lines may form, each seeking to impose debilitating fatigue on the other teams. Fatigue is a decisive factor in the outcome of every race. Cyclists' range of peripheral vision is a significant factor in peloton formation.[8]

Peloton formations have been described as exhibiting two main phases of behavior: a compact, low-speed formation, and a single-file, high-speed formation.[3] Peloton phases are indicated by thresholds in collective output that can be modeled mathematically and computationally.[3][9] The principles of phase behavior identified by Trenchard et al. have been applied to optimize engineering problems.[10]

Similarly, these thresholds in peloton formations define transitions between peloton cooperative behavior and free-riding behavior.[11] Cooperation and free-riding in pelotons have been studied using game theory and as a social dilemma,[12][13][14] and have also been considered in terms of equivalencies to aspects of economic theory.[15]

Basic peloton behaviors have also been modelled with robots,[16][17] and principles of peloton behavior have also been considered in relation to the future of collective robot behavior.[18]
