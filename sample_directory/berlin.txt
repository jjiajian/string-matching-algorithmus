It is my first year in Berlin. Berlin is the capital city of Germany. With a population of almost 4 million, Berlin is no doubt the largest city in Germany. Berlin is a city rich of culture and history. On Weekends, I enjoy going to the park and walk my dog, Sally, which is 2 years old. I have been to many different parks in the city but still my favourite park is Mauerpark as it is always very lively.
